# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures and test data for the Citadel Agent workflow engine.

## Overview
Test fixtures provide standardized data and configuration for consistent testing including:
- Sample workflow definitions
- Mock user accounts
- Test database schemas
- Configuration templates
- Mock API responses

## Fixture Types
- `workflows/` - Sample workflow definitions for testing
- `users/` - Mock user accounts and permissions
- `nodes/` - Sample node configurations
- `databases/` - Test database schemas and data
- `configurations/` - Test configuration files
- `responses/` - Mock API responses

## Standards
- Fixtures must be self-contained
- Data should be realistic and varied
- Fixtures must not depend on external services
- All fixtures should be documented
- Data should be version-controlled

## Usage
Fixtures are automatically loaded during test runs but can be used independently for manual testing.
