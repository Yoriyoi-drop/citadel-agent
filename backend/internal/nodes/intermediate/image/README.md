# Intermediate Image Nodes

This directory contains intermediate image nodes for the Citadel Agent workflow engine.

## Overview
Intermediate image nodes provide moderately advanced image processing operations including:
- Object detection and recognition
- Image enhancement and filtering
- Batch image processing
- Image analysis and metadata extraction
- Format conversion and optimization

## Available Nodes
- `object_detector_node.go` - Detects objects within images
- `image_enhancer_node.go` - Enhances image quality and appearance
- `batch_processor_node.go` - Processes multiple images in batch
- `image_analyzer_node.go` - Analyzes image content and metadata
- `format_optimizer_node.go` - Optimizes image formats for different uses

## Usage
These nodes are designed for intermediate image workflows with advanced processing.

## Requirements
- Image processing libraries
- Object detection models
- Batch processing capabilities
- Sufficient computational resources

## Security & Permissions
- Requires image file access permissions
- Image processing privileges
