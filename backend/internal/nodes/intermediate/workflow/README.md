# Intermediate Workflow Nodes

This directory contains intermediate workflow nodes for the Citadel Agent workflow engine.

## Overview
Intermediate workflow nodes provide moderately advanced workflow operations including:
- Parallel execution orchestration
- Complex conditional branching
- Workflow state management
- Workflow analytics and monitoring
- Dynamic workflow composition

## Available Nodes
- `parallel_orchestrator_node.go` - Orchestrates parallel execution of workflow steps
- `conditional_brancher_node.go` - Implements complex conditional branching logic
- `state_manager_node.go` - Manages workflow state and persistence
- `workflow_analyzer_node.go` - Analyzes workflow performance and metrics
- `dynamic_composer_node.go` - Composes workflows dynamically

## Usage
These nodes are designed for intermediate workflow workflows with orchestration.

## Requirements
- Workflow orchestration systems
- State persistence mechanisms
- Analytics systems
- Conditional evaluation engines
- Dynamic composition tools

## Security & Permissions
- Requires workflow orchestration permissions
- State management privileges
